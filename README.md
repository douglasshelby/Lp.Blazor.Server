# Lp.Blazor.WebApp

### Thoughts and approach
- requested Blazor Server, so used ```dotnet new blazor -int Server``` to scaffold
- load and sanity test the data for consistency
- strongly type to a model
- use a static 'data' instance to server the data
- seems mostly an exercise it choosing visualization components
- use a few views
    - show raw data in a grid with some basic functionality
    - show graphs of relevant slices
- some visualization options
